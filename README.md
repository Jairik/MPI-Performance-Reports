# Performance Analysis on MPI Program using Amdahl's Law

This program will aim to generate full autonomous performance analysis reports of the summation program (or any) using Amdahl's Law.

## Plan:

- Run generate_plots.py with optional arguments (.c file name, defaulted to summation.c), then intake the number of cores to test (default = 1 (serial), 2, and 8), 

- Make an easy BASH script to automatically port forward to the HTML file & open it for easy viewing

- Will also need to probably make a PDF report with a little more description on everything maybe
